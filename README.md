This project is a responsive and interactive Stock Tracking Dashboard that showcases simulated real-time stock updates with branding inspired by Zerodha and Motilal Oswal. Built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this frontend-only web application offers users a sleek and informative interface to visualize stock data, portfolio summaries, and market news. The dashboard features dual-themed stock sections representing Zerodha and Motilal Oswal, each displaying live-updating stock prices with color-coded changes to simulate market dynamics. Users can toggle between dark and light themes for a personalized viewing experience, and a mock "Login using SMTP" button is included as a placeholder for future authentication integration. The project also includes a portfolio analysis section with mock financial figures and a news section highlighting key market headlines. The layout is fully responsive and styled using CSS Flexbox, making it accessible across devices. With its clean code and modular structure, this dashboard serves as a great starting point for building real-time financial tracking platforms or expanding into a full-fledged stock analysis tool using APIs and backend support.
